Here's a comprehensive curriculum blueprint with a focus on statistical mastery across theory, application, and hands-on workflows. I’ve structured it into Core Topics, Advanced Concepts, and Hands-On Skills, with emphasis on real-world relevance, interview depth, and deployment readiness.

📘 Core Statistics Topics (Foundational Must-Knows)
These form the bedrock of statistical reasoning and are essential for any data scientist:

🔢 Descriptive Statistics
- Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
- Measures of dispersion: variance, standard deviation, IQR
- Skewness and kurtosis
- Data visualization: histograms, boxplots, density plots
  
🎲 Probability Theory
- Basic probability rules (addition, multiplication)
- Conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem
- Independence and mutual exclusivity
- Combinatorics (permutations, combinations)

📊 Distributions
- Discrete: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Geometric
- Continuous: Uniform, Normal, Exponential, Gamma
- Central Limit Theorem
- Law of Large Numbers

📈 Inferential Statistics
- Sampling techniques and bias
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing (Z-test, t-test, chi-square, ANOVA)
- p-values, Type I/II errors, statistical power

🧠 Advanced Statistical Concepts (For Modeling & Decision Science)
These are critical for ML interpretability, experimentation, and causal inference:

🧪 Experimental Design
- Randomized controlled trials
- A/B testing and multi-armed bandits
- Blocking, stratification, factorial designs

📐 Regression Analysis
- Linear regression: assumptions, diagnostics, multicollinearity
- Logistic regression: odds ratios, ROC curves
- Regularization: Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
- Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

🧮 Multivariate Statistics
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Factor analysis
- Canonical correlation
- MANOVA

🧩 Bayesian Statistics
- Prior, likelihood, posterior
- Conjugate priors
- Bayesian inference vs frequentist
- MCMC methods (Gibbs, Metropolis-Hastings)

🧬 Time Series & Forecasting
- Stationarity, autocorrelation, ACF/PACF
- ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing
- Kalman filters, Hidden Markov Models
- Prophet, VAR models

🧪 Causal Inference
- Counterfactuals and potential outcomes
- DAGs and do-calculus
- Instrumental variables
- Propensity score matching

🛠️ Hands-On & Applied Skills (Tooling + Workflow)
These bridge theory with deployment and reproducibility:

|----------|----------|----------|
|Descriptive Stats  | pandas, numpy | dplyr, summary() | 
|Visualization  | matplotlib, seaborn, plotly | ggplot2, lattice | 
|Hypothesis Testing  | scipy.stats, statsmodels | stats, car | 
|Regression  | statsmodels, sklearn | lm(), glm() | 
|Bayesian  | PyMC, TensorFlow Probability | rstan, brms | 
|TimeSeries  | statsmodels, prophet | forecast, tsibble |

🧭 Interview & Strategy Topics
- How to explain p-values and confidence intervals to non-technical stakeholders
- Trade-offs between frequentist and Bayesian approaches
- When to use bootstrapping vs parametric inference
- How to design robust experiments under budget constraints
- Statistical pitfalls in ML (e.g., data leakage, Simpson’s paradox)
